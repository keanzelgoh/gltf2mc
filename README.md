This project allows you to convert .gltf 3D model files to .json suitable for use in Minecraft.
This project is easy-to-use and no coding skills are required.

This project is licensed.

***How to Use***

1. Install Python (the latest version reccommended) in https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the repository. It is better if you keep it in your Downloads folder. The directory would be Downloads/gltf2mc
3. Prepare the GLTF and the pairing scene.bin file in the folder.<img width="304" height="116" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-15 at 17 29 26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca3a5c05-04e5-4082-987a-c0281592cb72" />
4. Open file `run_gltf2mcb.py` in a IDE and change the input file, output file and model name<img width="396" height="115" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-15 at 17 35 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e4c159-fc3e-445b-a2c5-38ef2308f9ae" />
5. Run Terminal/Command Prompt and run `cd Downloads/gltf2mc/`
6. Then run `python3 run_gltf2mcb.py` or `python run_gltf2mcb.py` (if the first one doesn't work)
7. You will see your .json file in the gltf2mc/Output folder


***Disclamer***
1. The copyright of the 3D models used for the converter are not related nor gltf2mc will take responsibilty of the inconvenience used.
2. The converter does not import textures to the .json model. If adding textures, please use external software like Blockbench (https://www.blockbench.net/downloads) to import the texture.
3. This converter shall not be used for commercial purposes or for-profit purposes
4. This converter shall not be used for the training or other purposes with AI.
5. Errors caused by the changing of this code will not be the responsibility of gltf2mc.
6. The code should not be taken seriously and may cause damages, errors or unusual/weird tweaks.
7. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION! Errors caused by other factors may cause damages, errors or unusual/weird tweaks.
8. Please note that the voxel size is set to `0.1`. You may change this voxel size, the more higher the more low resolution. If there is errors when changed, we reccommend to use the default 0.1.
9. The converter changes models to approximate cubes. Maximum cubes is set to `9000`. You may change the maximum cubes. The more the higher resolution. If there is errors, use the default `9000`.
10. You may contribute to the development to make other alternative languages.
11. There is no "official support page" to this day. Please kindly use SNS instead like Reddit or Quora.
